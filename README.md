Spring Boot Microservices-Based E-Commerce System
GitHub: Project Repository

Description:
Developed a scalable, modular, and cloud-ready microservices-based e-commerce system using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. The application is divided into three core microservices:

Product Service: Manages product creation and retrieval.
Order Service: Handles order placement and processing.
Inventory Service: Checks stock availability for products.
Each microservice is designed to work independently while communicating via REST APIs.

Key Features:
✅ Implemented RESTful APIs for seamless inter-service communication.
✅ Used Spring Boot for rapid development and Spring Data JPA for database interaction.
✅ Integrated Maven multi-module architecture to manage multiple microservices efficiently.
✅ Ensured high scalability and maintainability using a loosely coupled design.
✅ Applied Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring and health checks.
✅ Leveraged Lombok for reducing boilerplate code and improving code readability.
✅ Designed with clean architecture principles, keeping services modular and independent.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
API Development: Spring Web, RESTful APIs
Build & Dependency Management: Maven
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL (assumed based on project context)
Logging & Monitoring: Spring Boot Actuator
Version Control: Git, GitHub
This project showcases expertise in microservices architecture, Spring Boot, API development, and modular system design, making it ideal for enterprise-grade applications.
